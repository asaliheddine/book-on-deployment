## How to save on hosting
### AWS Elastic Beanstalk

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a part of AWS computing services, EC2. And it's not free after 12 months of using. But if you use the service during this period of time unreasonably, you will be charged. To avoid charging:

- create only one application with one environment that uses load balancing and HTTPS
- select a micro instance for computing

You also will get the email about possible $300 credits on AWS services. Register, they usually give their credit.

Another opportunity is to register on YC Startup School, they have a partnership with many companies, including Amazon. Their deal is $3000 what is great, isn't it?
