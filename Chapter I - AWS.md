# Chapter I. Deployment to AWS Elastic Beanstalk
## Basics of deployment
### Everything starts from account
Before you start the deployment to AWS, you have to create an account. It's simple. 
All you need to enter is your email and password. Then they will ask you to provide more details: type of your account (personal or professional). They will also ask for a credit card information (even if you are not going to pay).

*Does anybody know what's the difference between two these types of account?*

At the very end they will require to verify your account by phone - using a voice message or SMS.

After all these steps done you will able to chose from the plans: Basic (free), Developer, or Business. Don't worry about support - even on a free account there are ways to use their support (for example, to leave a feedback, or send an unquire).
